BTCeApi
=======
It is btc-e.com API .NET Library

This full-featured btc-e.com API wrapper written in C# provides a quick access to all available BTC-E features.

Because of good design and clean natural object oriented approach, the library is easy to use. 

I guess it can save some time for developers who are implementing their own trading strategies. You can easily build
your strategy with this library as the base.

You can look for code examples in SamplesProject which is a part of the solution.

See the API documentation (https://btc-e.com/api/documentation) for more details on arguments to these methods.
